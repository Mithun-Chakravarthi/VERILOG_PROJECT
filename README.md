Hello!
I am Mithun Chakravarthi currently pursuing my BTech in Electronics and communication Engineering.
I am particulary interested in VLSI field in the domain of RTL design and verification.
In this repo I am dumping all the projects I have been doing throughout my learning process.
Hope this may be useful to anyone intrested in doing projects in VLSI field.
